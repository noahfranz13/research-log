Markdown files with my research logs. Organized by year directory, month directory, `day.md` files

It should be setup where (if you have emacs installed) you just need to run `./open.sh` and it will either open the existing log for that day or create you a new log for that day from the template and then open it.

The `./search.sh phrase` command will search for whatever phrase follows the command.
