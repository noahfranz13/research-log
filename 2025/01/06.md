# January 06, 2025 Research Log
### General Notes
* Back to working on research after the holiday!
* First thing this morning I merged a PR from Jacob on the astro education notebooks where he pickled the isochrone data to save some space and time
* I've been working on OTTER stuff since
  * Added the xray_model keyword to the Masterson+24 X-ray dataset
  * Fixed the TNS pipeline for OTTER now since stuff was crashing since they upgraded the API
  * Fixed some bugs with the website not displaying data
  * Make the tables on the website auto sorted by discovery date (and properly sort by discovery date)
  * Pinged the people at SciServer to see if they have any updates
  
### Completed
* Incorporated the new xray model schema into the OTTER pipeline!
