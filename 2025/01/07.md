# January 07, 2025 Research Log
### General Notes
* Reformatted the AT2017bcc data from Ridley+2023
  * This took a while because of silly little things that I forgot I needed to worry about over the holiday. Hopefully this will save me time when working with Aprajita's and Muryel's datasets
	* Always make sure I re-upload to the Arango database after running the pipeline! This is purposefully not done automatically...
	* Make sure all X-ray filters have a minimum and maximum wavelength stored in the filter_alias keyword
* Met with Ed and Jacob to solidify a plan and goals for the semester for the astro education independent study
