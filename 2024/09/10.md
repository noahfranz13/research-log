### General Notes
* I haven't done this in a while, oops! I am still trying to build the habit...
* Over the past ~week I did a lot on the web otter front end website including
adding a search page and prettying up the home page with a sky plot.
* Today I added a classification search mechanism to the search page

### Completed
* Classification search mechanism on otter-web frontend
* Opened PRs for the minor planet checking in the SAGUARO vetting code

### Notes for the future
* Currently the classification search mechanism will grab anything with a
so-called confidence > 0. This is because we haven't defined the confidence
value in detail yet. Once we do, we should add a slider to this search page that
allows others to select the confidence threshold they want!
* Notes from the SAGUARO MP checker
  * Do we really want the MP checker to automatically run when we click the vet button?
  This seems to add a lot of time waiting.
  * How should the results of the MP checker appear on the website for the target? Right
  now I have it changing the classification to "Minor Planet / Asteroid".
