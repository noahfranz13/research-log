### General Notes
* Started digging into how to actually format the X-ray data for OTTER
  * Organized Aprajita's X-ray data into the new schema that includes an xray_model keyword
  * Sent an email to Raf checking in about if this is a good schema plan to use
* Modelled the ECLE radio data as a single power law since all of them are decaying anyways.
  * All of them have a p consistent with 2-4 which is promising!
  * I think this means that the B5 synchrotron model from 5/2 to a break at (1-p)/2 is valid.
