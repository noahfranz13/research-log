### General Notes
* Talked to Collin about following up the newly identified TDE 2020ukj with VLA
  * I checked VLASS and found 
  e1 (pre-disruption): max w/in aperture = 0.402 ; RMS = 0.128
  e2 (post-disruption, dt~13d): max w/in aperture = 0.299 ; RMS = 0.131
  e3 (long post-disruption): max w/in aperture = 0.263 ; RMS = 0.109
  * The e1 data point is an upperlimit even though the RMS is slightly under the max w/in aperture * 1/3, this is because there is some weird reduction artifact in the image. 
  * We might write a DDT on this
* Found all the ZTF public data for ECLEs 
  * Trying to also query ATLAS but it is not working so great, just keeps hanging
  * Also need to scrape papers for their data if it is public
