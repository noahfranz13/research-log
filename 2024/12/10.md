### General Notes
* Studying for galaxies this morning, have ISM final soon
* ISM exam went well I think!
* Did a little investigating into finding host galaxies with BLAST 
  * This is worthwhile for OTTER, SAGUARO, and TROVE!
  * I'm starting by writing the code for SAGUARO but it should be similar for the others too
