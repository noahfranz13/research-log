# December 02, 2024 Research Log
### General Notes
* Fixed TNS slack bot this morning
* OTTER
  * Updated the helm chart based on the SciServer people's comments
  * Update some of the OTTER readmes to reflect changes that I've made in the past few months
  * Now been working on a better upload method for the otter API that uses a vetting collection instead of just some local directory. --> I got this done throughout the day! And am now working on adding it to the otter-web interface to make that faster and more scalable

### Completed
* 

### Notes for the future
* I NEED to do my big boom presentation tomorrow!
* Rewrote all of the vetting code but it needs to be better tested!

### Any Leftover notes from yesterday
