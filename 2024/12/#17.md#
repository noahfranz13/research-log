### General Notes
* Space Drafts #102 advertisements: Posted on the Bluesky and sent the all steward email (scary!!)
* OTTER Stuff
  * Got the otter web app up and running publicly using the NiceGUI on_air feature!
  * Improved the database security with 3 users now. Unfortunately, everytime I restart the otter database I will have to redefine all of these users
	1. root: Password protected user that has admin access everywhere
	2. vetting-user: Password protected user that has access to the vetting collection and can make modifications to it. Only has read access to the transients collection.
	3. user-guest: Only has read access to the transients collection. Not password protected.

### Completed
* Digging into OTTER DB security seems to be in a good state now!
