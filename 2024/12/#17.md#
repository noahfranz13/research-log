### General Notes
* Space Drafts #102 advertisements: Posted on the Bluesky and sent the all steward email (scary!!)
* Completed my department course evals
* OTTER Stuff
  * Got the otter web app up and running publicly using the NiceGUI on_air feature!
  * Improved the database security with 3 users now. Unfortunately, everytime I restart the otter database I will have to redefine all of these users
	1. root: Password protected user that has admin access everywhere
	2. vetting-user: Password protected user that has access to the vetting collection and can make modifications to it. Only has read access to the transients collection.
	3. user-guest: Only has read access to the transients collection. Not password protected.
  * Read up on X-ray data reduction to try to get a better idea of the stuff Raf was requesting to be stored in OTTER. I skimmed Ch. 4 and 5 in "Handbook of X-ray Astronomy" and read some of the sections in each of those chapters in more details.
	* It sounds like xspec is the commonly used NASA software, all of their models are defined here: https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/Models.html
	* The spectral models can have multiple components that are either added or multiplied together. 
	* Integrating under the spectral models in counts/s/cm^2/energy vs. energy space gives an energy/s/cm^2 (or erg/s/cm^2), this is why we need to assume the spectral model of the source!
	* These spectral models are only accounting for unabsorbed flux, just like at other wavelengths there can be flux absorbed by Hydrogen between us and the source. For example, Aprajita reports both an unabsorbed and absorbed flux in her paper on ASASSN-15oi. This "absorbed flux" can be treated like we treat optical extinction at UVOIR wavelengths.

### Completed
* Digging into OTTER DB security seems to be in a good state now!

### Notes for the future
* Thinking about all of this X-ray stuff has given me some ideas for storing the X-ray photometry in OTTER:
  We could do something like the following
  ```
  photometry : {
	  [
		obs_type: xray,
		raw: [...],
		raw_err: [...],
		raw_unit: "ct/s"
		err_details: [...],
		value: [...],
		value_err: [...],
		value_unit: "erg/s/cm^2",
		xray_model: [
			{
				model_name: "", # preferably the xspec model name
				param_names: [],
				param_values: [],
				param_descriptions: []
				model_url: "" # An optional model url 
			}
		]
		
	  ]
  }
  ```
  
I think the one big remaining question I have here is do we need to have code that uses these models? Or do they just need to be present so astronomers can understand how the flux values were computed? Because the answer to this question changes how much standardization we give the `xray_model` keyword.
