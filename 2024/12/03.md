### General Notes
* Need to put together my Big Boom presentation today! I think it will help me figure out how to outline the further investigation into the ECLE radio properties!
  * Finished up the history and current context of our ECLE analysis
  * Had some meetings but just now getting back to making my plots prettier for the slides tomorrow!
  * Fixed the FIRST query so I queried for 5" instead of 5'. This turned up only one detection instead of all of the offset ones I had from before.
  * Fixed the radio lightcurve plots for ECLEs, need to look into a few that have two VLASS images at a single point

### Completed

### Notes for the future
* Some notes on the cleaning choices I made to get rid of duplicated images from VLASS. First, after talking to Collin, we think this occurs because the 1 arcmin region surrounding the TDE is partially in the region of overlapping fields from the VLASS survey strategy tesselating. We found this by opening all of the images in ds9, locking on the WCS, and then the square images are centered on the correct location and the rectangular ones are not.
* I am deleting all of the non-square quick look VLASS images to address this for the following events: AT2018bcb, 
* For AT2022fpx, VLASS Epoch 2.1 had both a QL and SE image, I am removing the QL image because the SE image is higher quality/better reduction
* For SDSSJ1055, I did the same as for AT2022fpx
* For SDSSJ1715, I did the same as for AT2022fpx
