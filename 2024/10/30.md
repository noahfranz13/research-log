# October 30, 2024 Research Log
### General Notes
* I've been messing with Helm charts and Kubernetes all morning
  * I've found that installing arangodb in the Hlem chart is non trivial :(
  * Essentially you need to isntall the CRDs separately
  ```
  # install the CRDs
  helm repo add arangodb https://arangodb.github.io/kube-arangodb
  helm repo update
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arangodb/kube-arangodb/master/manifests/arango-crd.yaml\
  
  # verify isntallation
  kubectl get crds | grep arango
  ```
  * everything got deleted somehow and now I'm back to square one with literally no idea how I did some 
    of the stuff from this morning
