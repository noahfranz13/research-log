# October 31, 2024 Research Log
### General Notes
* Helm/Kubernetes
  * `kubectl` says that arango is started but I still can't go to the url, maybe I have the wrong url?
  * Still can't seem to get the otter website running in the kubernetes server even though the ports are mapped properly I think
  * Got arangodb up and running in kubernetes but without installation
  * To see it we needed to run the following commands to expose the minikube ports
  ```
  minikube tunnel # in one terminal
  # then open another terminal and run
  kubectl expose deployment otterdb-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=8529
  kubectl expose deployment otterweb-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
  # then run 
  kubectl get svc
  # and go to the EXTERNAL-IP:PORT
  ```

### Completed
* Everything with helm/kubernetes is kinda working now! That means more progress than yesterday! Thank you chatGPT =)
