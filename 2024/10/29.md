### General Notes
* Instrumentation Midterm
  * Skimmed through Ch 1 & 2 of "Measuring the Universe" and, more importantly, went through some of the problems.
  * Went to Meredith's office hours, she said focus on SNR and Plate Scale calculations which is what I have been doing. I'm a little less concerned now, hopefully it goes fine!
* OTTER Bug Fixes
  * Created an algorithm to better scale the x and y axes on the light curve plots on the inidividual transient pages
  * Fixed some bugs where the API fails when searching for a discovery date and host. I just have those two getter methods return None now instead of crashing.
* SciServer Meeting Notes
  *
