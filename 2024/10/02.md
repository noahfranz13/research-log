### General Notes
* ECLE Stuff
  * I queried FIRST and NVSS for our population of 24 ECLEs. Some had FIRST data, none had NVSS data
  * I also check RACS and didn't find it useful, everything seems non constraining for our case
    * I suspect the radio emission from J0938 is just host contamination based on the RACS data and the long term lightcurve from FIRST. This is expected given it’s classification as an AGN!
    * J1241 has no RACS data but the FIRST detections concern me a little. Although at later times we definitely see the radio emission decay. Remember that the discovery date for this is the publishing date though so this first radio detection could be the actual TDE occuring and what we see is some secondary late time flare. We have no way to verify this though unfortunately. Interesting!
    * J0952 has RACS data that just looks like noise (although it’s very low SNR). The light curve appears quite variable!!
* SAGUARO
  * I finished making the minor planet checker button run an asynchronous job
  * Discussed it with Griffin and it sounds like we want to use the date of the first photometric detection of the transient, NOT the discovery date. This is because discovery date can be arbitrarily defined and/or defined differently across different surveys
  
### Completed
* Checking more radio surveys for ECLE data 

### Notes for the future
* Fix MPC button to use the first photometric detection instead of the "discovery date"
