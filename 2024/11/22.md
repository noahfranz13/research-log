# November 22, 2024 Research Log
### General Notes
* Editing the sample astrobite right now to try to make it tell a more cohesive story
  * Sent it around to others to read
* Started working on the helm chart
  * Still working on these updates, stuff really just doesn't seem to want to work :(
  * I think I figured it out, just need to test it. I ended up using the video here https://discuss.kubernetes.io/t/why-can-i-not-connect-to-my-service-even-though-i-have-an-endpoint/16491, super useful! May need to watch some more of those videos.
