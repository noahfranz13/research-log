# November 08, 2024 Research Notes
### Steward Internal Symposium Notes
Each bullet will be labelled by speakers name, then notes underneath that.

* Aaron Meisner
  * Staff astronomer at NOIRLab
  * Worked a lot on unWISE coadded images of WISE survey
  * Many more Brown Dwarfs (1 per every MS star) than previously expected
  * They've found a few SUPER COOL and SUPER low metallicity that break models

* Yu-Chia Lin
  * HICE --> High Contrast Images of Exoplanets

* Brittany Miles
  * Trying to understand how convection effects brown dwarf atmosphere
  * Every JWST wavelength probes a different pressure

* Rajat Ravi
  * The Hypergiant Star: VY Canis Majoris
  * 40 M_sun
  * Intense mass loss rate > 1e-4 M_sun/yr
  * Star in LTE up to ~60 R_sun
  * PN emission is much more extended than PO (what are PN and PO?)

* Jacob Isbell
  * Studying dusty "torus" (really a disk with some radiation driven wind)
  * LBTI has an effective resolution of a 22.8m telescope
  * Using LBTI can spatially separate shock bubbles from AGN
  * IR tracing of AGN radio jet, particularly in the Seyfert I

* Roger Angel
  * Adaptive Optics for Concentrated Solar Energy
  * Uses a 7m^2 heliostat to focus the sun light
  * AO helps fix the astigmatism
  * Images the sun as well as we can during the eclipse
  * Can also be used for CO2 capture to help climate change

* Kate Gold
  * Planetary Nubulae (PNe) Organic Chemistry
  * T_star > 30,000 K
  * Current chemical model abundances of PNe Molecular abundances are dismal
  * Has radio data from ARO 12m and other one

* Yongda Zhu
  * Epoch of Reionization: Gives details of formation and evolution of first stars, galaxies, and BHs
  * Key question: What is the ionizing photon production efficiency of galaxies? And what is it's environmental dependence?
  * Measure overdensity from JADES at cosmic noon
  * Discovered strong positive correlation between ionizing photon production efficiency and the overdensity

* Aafaque Khan
  * On ASPERA
  * Mapping OVI emission around nearby galaxies
  * Spectrograph from 101 - 106 nm
  * Flight optics are ready, 2 gratings (one is a spare) are ready but need to be installed, Great QE (for UV detectors)
  * Need 6 mos in orbit at least and that's what they have, obviously want more though if possible

* Avery Bailey
  * Modeling circumplanetary disks
  * Sites of satellite formation and the final state of planets
  * Direct observational signatures of planet formation
  * Can we simulate 3D but only in 2D by averaging over one of the dimensions?
  * 2D and 3D are fairly similar, maybe off by a factor of a few

* Rebecca Lipson
  * TIMESTEP --> Impacts and Opportunities
  * Weekly professional development meetings for undergrads
  * Summer Tech Internship to get undergrads with astro majors experience in tech
  * Helping students understand different career options
  * Apprenticeship program work with graduate students and faculty to get experience in things to get other internships

* Hina Suzuki
  * Direct calibration algorithm for ADS Interleaving
  * want to increase from 64 -> 128 Gbps

* Allison Towner
  * 

* Vikram Manikantan

* Pranjal R.S.

* Eric Pearce
