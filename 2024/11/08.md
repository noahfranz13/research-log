# November 08, 2024 Research Notes
## General Notes
* Most of the day at the internal symposium
* Also spent some time looking at the JWST spectra of GRB240825A that Tanmoy sent Collin and I! It was cool to use JWST data, it has such a high SNR!

### Morning Session 2

* Allison Towner
  * Material passes through the accretion disk en route to star --> some of this will form planets instead
  * CO line emission used to predict presence of protoplanetary disk
  * Can constrain the protostellar age, assuming an isochrone model for the star (or disk?)

* Vikram Manikantan
  * SMBBHs are excellent multi-messenger sources
  * SMBBHs are difficult to confirm, not observed directly with Pulsar Timing Arrays
  * Uses simulations to understand what eccentricity looks like in SMBBHs
  * Eccentric binaries have a frequency of jet bursts that is the same as the orbital frequency of the binary

* Pranjal R.S.
  * Cluster lensing with O(1) Galaxies
  * To find lensed galaxies we can break the degeneracy between intrinsic shape and lensing squashing by looking at a radial velocity curve of the galaxy.
  * This method has been observationally confirmed.

* Eric Pearce
  * Space Domain Awareness and Survey Astronomy
  * His team has increased their search rate

* Neev Shah
  * Forming X-ray binaries
  * How do stars die?
  * A known X-ray binary is ejected from a host by a supernova that formed it, this constrains the progenitor properties
  * Using MESA to understand how the binary could have formed
  * Can also use this methodology to probe the predicted EM emission from GW events

* Antranik Sefilian
  * Interested in Probes of Planetary Systems
  * Uses ALMA to probe debris disks of proto-planetary systems
  * Their observations show that most of the inferred planets lie in a region of parameter space that we can not detect

* Sophie Lebowitz
  * AGN ionization cones at cosmic noon
  * AGN Feedback is implicated in cosmological simulations to suppress star formation, this is normally probed in the narrow line region of AGN
  * JWST provides a unique opportunity to probe the [OIII] maps of AGN ionization cones
  * Some other AGN they call "Compact Narrow Line Regions" which don't have obvious jets
    * could be a viewing angle effect
  * Hint at a less steep high redshift trend than the low redshift sample

* Kevin Hainline
  * Excited about things in the IR
  * Main conclusion is that there are way more bright galaxies at high redshift than expected

* Lily Whitler
  * More luminous high-z galaxies than expected

* Jackie Champagne

  * Future work is going to even higher spatial resolution to map the atomic gas that may contribute to the extended [CII] line emission at large radii

  * Sgr A* changes on t ~ 4-27 min
  * Lightcurves show that there is also ~few month variations in ALMA Band 3-6
  * Wants to improve the model of the minispiral/extended structure for better modeling of variable point source

* Nicole Melso
  * Emission from the CGM is a challenging detection
  * Instrument optimization for the Low-z CGM --> small aperature, high grasp instrument, moderate resolution, large FOV
  * Low Surface Brightness IFS with CHaS --> IFS so every point in the image is a spectrum, designed to reach ultra-low SB
  * Future low surface brightness instrumentation are compact survet instruments for both ground and space-based spectral imaging
