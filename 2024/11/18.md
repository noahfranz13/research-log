### General Notes
* Been working on my galaxies hw
  * Dave said in class to reuse the isochrones from an earlier homework for the problem 1 cuts
* Meeting with Tanmoy
  * He corrected some of my misnomers about radio emission from ECLEs
  * I need to reread some of the ECLE papers to get a better idea of why they are *Extreme* and not just coronal lines
  * I should reach out to the Co-I's on Kate's original proposal and see if they can send it so I can get a better idea of a science question
  * I should look at the x-rays from these events  (if there are any)
