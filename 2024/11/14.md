### General Notes
* SAGUARO Meeting went well
  * We are doing a TROVE hack session tomorrow
  * MPC checker might be timing out, but I don't think so? I think it's something weird with dramatiq
* Worked on Galaxies HW 4 this morning mostly, it's so long :(((
* Grad admissions meeting with Nathan and other grad students to give feedback
* Met with Sebastian
  * He supports modeling everything in OTTER with mosfit eventually
  * I sent him the paper draft
  * He will try to install OTTER locally for development and reach out if he has questions
  * He will email Raffaella Margutti about meeting about x-ray stuff
* Started a rerun of mosfit on sdu and zso for Collin, here's the command I used for future reference
```
mpirun -np 3 mosfit -e mosfit_input/*.json -c -o mosfit_output -m tde --local-data-only --run-until-converged -N 120
```
which runs it on all of the json files in the `mosfit_input` directory, writes both chains and output parameters to `mosfit_output`, runs emcee until converged, and with 120 walkers.
