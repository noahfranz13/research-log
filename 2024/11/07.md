### General Notes

### Completed

### Notes for the future
* Need to do the equipartition analysis on the ECLE modelling results. Should talk to Collin about this.

### Any Leftover notes from yesterday
* I didn't do a good job of taking research notes yesterday while observing, here's a summary.
* Mostly just observing, but got spectra of 16ezh and 19dsg! Will reduce ASAP and see if there are CLs
* Spent a little bit fixing some of the radio SED modeling for the ECLEs. Mostly wrote some code to choose sideband or fullband points and refit everything. Also saved the chains so I can continue doing analysis elsewhere.
* Caught up on missed class notes/work from tuesday and wednesday.
