# November 07, 2024 Research Log
### General Notes
* Got down from the mountain early afternoon. Planning to catch up on ISM notes I missed today and maybe start looking into equipartition analysis a bit more.
* Started the xdisk data backup on globus. I tried last night using rsync but that seems to have failed with such a large dataset. So this is a better solution.
* Went through ISM notes I missed today.
* I will need to do the equipartition analysis at a later date then!

### Completed
* 

### Notes for the future
* Need to do the equipartition analysis on the ECLE modelling results. Should talk to Collin about this.

### Any Leftover notes from yesterday
* I didn't do a good job of taking research notes yesterday while observing, here's a summary.
* Mostly just observing, but got spectra of 16ezh and 19dsg! Will reduce ASAP and see if there are CLs
* Spent a little bit fixing some of the radio SED modeling for the ECLEs. Mostly wrote some code to choose sideband or fullband points and refit everything. Also saved the chains so I can continue doing analysis elsewhere.
* Caught up on missed class notes/work from tuesday and wednesday.
