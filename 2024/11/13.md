### General Notes
* Worked on lots this morning
  * Made some nicer plots of the TDE I observed for instrumentation
  * Worked on interpreting the ECLE Radio modeling
  * Started galaxies homework
* Tanmoy's Big Boom Talk
  * GRB220101A
  * Used same model as what worked for the afterglow of GRB 221009A (The "BOAT")
    * Excess emission seen in radio/mm from the BOAT --> Models don't really match
    * Likely a reverse shock
    * Fitting with broken power law gives unexpected (or unphysical?) peak flux and peak frequnecy decline
  * GRB220101A had the same problem where there was a reverse shock excess in the radio
  * The reverse shock jet model that fixes this:
    * Two parts of the jet:
      1) Poynting-flux-dominated narrow region in middle (only 0.6 deg radius) and
      2) matter-dominated wings
  * z ~ 4.6 --> High redshift for GRBs
  * relatively successfully modelled GRB220101A with both a forward and reverse shock component
  * Opening angle is 0.6 deg, even smaller than the BOAT
  * Density is very very low, on the order of IGM density not ISM density
  * This is the narrowest opening angle of any GRB
  * Most energetic afterglow of any GRB (~10x more so than the norm)
  * All GRB Jet's should be structured, if they have this two part structure from this model is unclear but it kinda works in this case!
* Collin's Big Boom Talk
