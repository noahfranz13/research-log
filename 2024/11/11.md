### General Notes
* Finished up the first draft of the Helm chart
  * Seems to work on my laptop but not desktop in the office. I think this is because my desktop is still trying to use cached docker images but I'm not sure how to tell it not to
* Redid the equipartition analysis
  * Fixed the equations to use the relativistic ones from Barniol Duran without any time dependence
  * setup bootstrapping to propagate the uncertainties through

### Completed
* Sent first attempt at Helm chart to SciServer

### Notes for the future
* 

### Any Leftover notes from yesterday
