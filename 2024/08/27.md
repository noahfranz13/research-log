# August 27, 2024 Research Log
### General Notes
* I didn't have class today so I got to work on research all day!
* I updated the `otterdb` repo so that it works with arangodb again
* Updated the OTTER API to work with the arangodb backend
* Found A LOT of mistakes in the dataset while working to get it into the website format

### Completed
* Reintegrating the dataset with arangodb (using docker so no one needs to install arangodb either!!)
* Updated the OTTER API to work with the arangodb backend
* Got nicegui app up and running with the arangodb backend

### Notes for the future
* Need to merge the branch I was working on for web-otter
* Need to message Nick and tell him what updates I made to his code to integrate better with what I had already done
